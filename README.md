This project includes multiple functions that can estimate Euler's value, Square Roots of inputted values, and pi using different methods. For the estimations of pi, the methods being used include Euler's solution, the Madhava series, the BBP (Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe) formula, and Viete's formula. <br/>
To compile this, run the included Makefile. This can be done by typing "make all". The executable is then created which can be run with specified inputs.<br/><br/>
If run with the -h input or without any,<br/> ./mathlib-test<br/>a menu will pop up that shows the different options that a user can use to test.<br/>
